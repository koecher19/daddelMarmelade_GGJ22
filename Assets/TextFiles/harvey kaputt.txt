Bruno hears the slow dripping of tough Blood coming out of the two-parted Harvey.
For seconds just an amusement in a show of absurdities
and in another moment a horrible feeling for eternity.
Not to mention the horrifying chainsaw-spectaculum that became reality.
He was alive… And now? Their bones start to shiver.
Guilt is crawling up the body while slowly realizing what had happened.
But who is to blame? maybe Bruno…?
