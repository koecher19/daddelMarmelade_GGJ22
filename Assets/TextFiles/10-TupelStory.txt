Bruno’s mind is blank. No exhausting errands anymore, but at what cost? Sitting between wet piles of trash. A foul odor surrounding them. They collapse in a tiny back alley, one of the many shit holes of this city. No one right in their mind ever comes here - unlike Bruno.

Trusting the wrong ones turned out to be fatal. They had lost everything. There was no way to continue living this way. No choice is left, but was there ever any, to begin with? Every day could be their last one, nowhere to go and nothing to eat.

They startle. Steps coming closer - they know steps mean trouble. People in this part of the city never have good intentions. Trying to make themself as small as possible would hopefully keep danger away.

The steps stopped in front of them. Bruno slowly looked up, right into an obnoxiously colored broadsheet.

Bruno finds themself entering a large room. The grotesque atmosphere and the smell of cigarette smoke hit them unexpectedly. They decided to come here, but the nerve wrecking feeling will not leave. The person standing right in front of Bruno does not change that. Everything about that man is intimidating. The suit, his height and the piercing gaze from his steel blue eyes.

 "Bruno. I know. I already heard of you. You’re supposed to be... intriguing. This circus needs a little more - spice. And my instincts told me you would be the perfect person for the job. That leads me to my offer: You should work here."
Take the job offer
Don't work here
