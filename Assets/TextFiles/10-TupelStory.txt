Bruno’s mind is blank. No exhausting errands anymore, but at what cost? Sitting between wet piles of trash. A foul odor surrounding them. They collapse in a tiny back alley, one of the many shit holes of this city. No one right in their mind ever comes here - unlike Bruno.

Trusting the wrong ones turned out to be fatal. They had lost everything. There was no way to continue living this way. No choice is left, but was there ever any, to begin with? Every day could be their last one, nowhere to go and nothing to eat.

They startle. Steps coming closer - they know steps mean trouble. People in this part of the city never have good intentions. Trying to make themself as small as possible would hopefully keep danger away.

Bruno finds themself entering a large room. The grotesque atmosphere and the smell of cigarette smoke hit them unexpectedly. They decided to come here, but the nerve wrecking feeling will not leave. The person standing right in front of Bruno does not change that. Everything about that man is intimidating. The suit, his height and the piercing gaze from his steel blue eyes.

The curtain opens. This is not what Bruno expected from a circus. A large tent with some tall pillars supporting the heavy tarpaulin. Without them the tent would definitely collapse. There is no grass growing, no dirt, the whole ground is covered in colored carpet. Everything is so - clean.

Harvey looks back and smiles at the younger boy. Tori, yet not small, is still smaller than Harvey. His light, fancy clothes are moving with every motion. The purple, puffy shorts, the black hair, and the white west complete the picture of an elegant artist. As soon as Tori sees Harveys' smile he blushes.

Harvey takes a step forward and signals Tori to step aside, who is doing so, looking at Harvey with a sparkle in his eyes. And even if Tori is skinny, behind his back hides another person. As soon as she gets recognized she winks but makes no sign of moving - standing stiff like a board.

Anyway, they should check out their room. Bruno does not expect much. But the least they expect when turning the doorknob, is the well-dressed man that stands in his room. A grimy look is on his face that is partly covered by an enormous mustache

Tori is crying, pulling his hair, pushing help away. He is not looking sad, he seems to be broken - empty like a candle without a wick. His mouth moves as if he wants to say something, but no sound comes over his lips. Donna is desperately trying to help him, but it seems to be senseless.

Nimue, on the other hand, has not cleaned her clothes. Blood is everywhere on her body and she's staring at the small particles of dust in the air - ignoring everything around her. At some point, she will get up, walk into her room and cry, but Bruno eventually won't see that.

Bruno is running straight to their room - Did they read the instructions wrong? After opening the door, they check for the note, but there is nothing else in his room but the small amount of interior. Has someone of the crew stolen it while Bruno was away? Or was it never even there?

Brunos head feels like it is going to explode. They is in their room. Not making any sound, while their thoughts are overwhelming them. Was it Bruno's fault? What about those instructions? And why aren’t these in Brunos room anymore? Why would anyone give them false instructions that would lead to something that terrible?

Guilt overcomes them and Bruno realizes that this feeling will never go away. A murderer. A failure. Someone that will never be worthy of making own decisions. The headache is unbearable. Their thoughts go crazy. They whisper. They laugh. They scream. All inside Bruno's head. This has to stop. This needs to stop. Whatever it takes.

Also, would they just come out and talk to us, if they would have killed Hervey on purpose? We offered help if they needed it. So, we help. We joined this circus a long time ago, only with help. So who are we to deny them help?"

Bruno, looking at two soulmates that are not happy anymore, is hurting them. But what could they have done to avoid that? Guilt, but also anger about the director, overcome Bruno. They decide to leave Avery and Celeste alone for now, going back to their room. They need time for themselves, so does Bruno.

Bruno saw all of it. They was standing on the edge of the tent to see how sunshine shines. The crew always said how hilarious her shows are… but now? There is no show of her anymore. Soon there will be no more shows at all. And again it was their fault. Like always. Only their fault.
